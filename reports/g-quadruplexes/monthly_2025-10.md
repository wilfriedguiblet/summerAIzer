- **Perspectives on NcRNAs in HBV/cccDNA-driven HCC progression.** - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration, the HBx protein (and its mutants), and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) are critical for HBV replication, packaging, and transmission to new host cells. [5]
- **Nucleic Acid-Modified Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapeutic Applications.** - Nanomaterials including metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, carbonous nanomaterial (e.g., carbon dots) or metal-organic framework nanoparticles provide porous, catalytically active surfaces and functional interfaces for binding of ions or molecular agents. [6]
- **DDX21 Is a Potential Biomarker for Predicting Recurrence and Prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.** - DEAD-box helicase 21 (DDX21) is a conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) box RNA helicase with multiple functions that is involved in various cellular processes and diseases. [7]
- **Redox-Driven Epigenetic Modifications in Sperm: Unraveling Paternal Influences on Embryo Development and Transgenerational Health.** - Male-factor infertility accounts for nearly half of all infertility cases, and mounting evidence points to oxidative stress as a pivotal driver of sperm dysfunction, genetic instability, and epigenetic dysregulation. [8]
- **Hydroxychloroquine's diverse targets: a new frontier in precision medicine.** - (no abstract available) [9]
- **Lysosomal membrane permeabilization enhances the anticancer effects of POLR1 (RNA polymerase I) transcription inhibitors.** - Lysosomes contribute to the development of drug resistance through various mechanisms that include drug sequestration and the activation of adaptive stress pathways. [10]
- **Pulse counting of nanobubbles inside DNA-functionalized nanopores and the application for highly sensitive electroanalysis.** - In conventional electrochemical biosensors, nanobubbles generated by electrochemical reactions typically adhere to the electrode interface, which affect the accuracy of measurements. [11]
- **Target-triggered G-quadruplex DNAzyme on electrospun nanofibrous films for multicolor visual detection of uracil-DNA glycosylase.** - <h4>Background</h4>Aberrant expression of UDG in vivo could disturb uracil excision repair process to cause various diseases such as bloom syndrome, human immune deficiency, neurodegeneration, and even cancer. [12]
- **DDX21 Promotes PCV3 Replication by Binding to Cap Protein and Inhibiting Interferon Responses.** - Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is an emerging pathogen that causes porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome-like symptoms, multisystemic inflammation, and reproductive failure. [13]
- **How do neurons live long and healthy? The mechanism of neuronal genome integrity.** - Genome DNA of neurons in the brain is unstable, and mutations caused by inaccurate repair can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. [14]
- **Stress granule and P-body clearance: Seeking coherence in acts of disappearance.** - Stress granules and P-bodies are conserved cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates whose assembly and composition are well documented, but whose clearance mechanisms remain controversial or poorly described. [15]
- **DNA Origami-Based Luminescent Biosensors Enabling Smartphone Detection of Nucleic Acid Sequences.** - DNA origami enables the precise assembly of complex nanostructures, facilitating the visual detection of various molecular targets. [16]
- **DExH-Box Helicase 9 Participates in De Novo Nrf2 Protein Translation Under Oxidative Stress.** - Nrf2 transcript factor plays an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress due to its control for expression of antioxidant and detoxification genes. [17]
- **Affinity-selected peptide ligands specifically bind i-motif DNA and modulate c-Myc gene expression** - c-Myc is an oncogene that is dysregulated in ~70% of cancers. [18]
- **Primary Sequence-Intrinsic Immune Evasion by Viral Proteins Guides CTL-Based Vaccine Strategies** - (no abstract available) [19]
- **ALS-associated FUS mutation reshapes the RNA and protein composition of stress granules.** - Stress granules (SG) are part of a cellular protection mechanism where untranslated messenger RNAs and RNA-binding proteins are stored upon conditions of cellular stress. [20]
